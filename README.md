## üì¶ Requirements

- Debian or Kali Linux
- GNOME or MATE desktop environment
- Git
- Internet connection for package installation

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sproffes/AnimeDeskRice.git
cd AnimeDeskRice
```
Or go to releases if you only want to download Terminal or Desktop setups.

2. Choose your rice for terminal or desktop:

### Terminal
The script now includes an optional Kitty terminal installation. While Kitty is recommended for the best experience, it's not mandatory.

Terminal configuration support is being expanded. If your terminal is not currently in the supported list (GNOME, XFCE, MATE), you'll need to manually configure the JetBrainsMono Nerd font in your terminal settings.

#### Kali Linux Installation
```bash
cd Terminal_Rice
chmod +x ZSH_THEME_kali+kitty.sh
./ZSH_THEME_kali+kitty.sh
```

#### Debian / Ubuntu Installation
```bash
cd Terminal_Rice
chmod +x ZSH_THEME_debian-ubuntu+kitty.sh
./ZSH_THEME_debian-ubuntu+Kitty.sh
```

### Desktop Environments
The desktop configuration scripts are designed for Debian-based distributions. Testing has been primarily conducted on Kali Linux and Debian.

1. GNOME Environment
```bash
cd Desktop_Rice
chmod +x Gnome_setup.sh
./Gnome_setup.sh
```

2. MATE Environment
```bash
cd Desktop_Rice
chmod +x Mate_setup.sh
./Mate_setup.sh
```

Log out and log back in to apply the changes.

### GNOME Customization Tools

#### GNOME Debloater
A utility is included to help remove pre-installed applications like LibreOffice or GNOME games. It also offers the option to install alternative applications such as:
- VSCodium
- Brave Browser
- LibreWolf
- Additional useful packages

#### GNOME Uninstaller (Beta)
A tool to remove the GNOME desktop environment is included but is currently in beta. It attempts to remove all main GNOME packages. If the system reboots unexpectedly during uninstallation, manually complete the cleanup with:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt purge
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Ensure you have an alternative desktop environment installed before using the GNOME uninstaller. Use at your own risk.
